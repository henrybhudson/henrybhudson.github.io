                Computing has been able to improve MRI scans by speeding up the imaging process, resulting in shorter
                scan times therefore image quality as it gives the patient less time to move around. This movement
                (called a motion artifact) would
                disrupt the imaging and decrease quality of the images. It has also led to enhanced image quality
                through noise reduction and artifact correction.
                <br /><br />
                Computing enables 3D imaging, which provides a much more comprehensive view of anatomical information.
                It also facilitates advanced analysis of data, allowing for more precise measurements and
                monitoring of any disease progression and treatment effectiveness quickly.

            <div class="block-content">
                Computers help PET scans to investigate the effectiveness of various treatments as well as to evaluate
                the health of a person's body. It achieves this by enabling:
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Recontruction - calculating the location of the source within the patient from the signals
                        received by cameras.</li>
                    <li>Image Processing - noise reduction of signals and artifact removal.</li>
                    <li>Analysis & AI - PET data can be fed through complex modelling and AI can be used to assist in
                        pattern recognition and disease detection.</li>
                    <li>Data Sharing & Storage - computing supports the management, retrieval and sharing of PET data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                It is clear that the entire process of PET scanning would be impossible without computers.
